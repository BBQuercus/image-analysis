# image-analysis
Image analysis pipelines used for my masters thesis in molecular biology.

My master thesis is in the Chao lab at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (Basel, Switzerland). Part of my project involved confocal microscopy of cellular samples. These images are analysed and quantified using a custom built pipeline written in python. My latest pipeline updates are accompanied by an example set of images. All code and images are under a MIT license (see LICENSE file).

The pipelines currently in this repository are:

- OptoG induction – Cellular spot detection to determine the induction efficiency of OptoGranules
- Colocalization – Cellular colocalization and spot detection to compare the recruitment of mRNAs to Granules (Halo-labelling, IF or OptoGs)

All jupyter notebooks are accompanied by a pure python file of the same name. These include a run_pipeline function used for batch processing. Furthermore, one exemplary data set is always included.
