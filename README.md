# image-analysis
Image analysis pipelines used for my masters thesis in molecular biology.

My master thesis is in the Chao lab at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (Basel, Switzerland). Part of my project involved confocal microscopy of cellular samples. These images are analysed and quantified using a custom built pipeline written in python. My latest pipeline updates are accompanied by an example set of images. 

- OptoG-induction – cellular spot detection to compare the induction efficiency of OptoGranules in different conditions.
- Colocalization – cellular colocalization to compare the recruitment of mRNAs with granules.
